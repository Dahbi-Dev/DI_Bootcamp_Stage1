        <p class="intro">

        <div class="poem">
            <div class="line">Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</div>
            <div class="line">Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</div>
            <div class="line">Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</div>
            <div class="line">And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</div>
            <div class="line">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</div>
            <div class="line">And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</div>
            <div class="line">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</div>
            <div class="line">By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</div>
            <div class="line">But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</div>
            <div class="line">Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</div>
            <div class="line">Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</div>
            <div class="line">When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</div>
            <div class="line">So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</div>
            <div class="line">So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</div>
